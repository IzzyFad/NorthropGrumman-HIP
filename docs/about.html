          <h2> Currently, there are no digital applications which allow the general public
to receive and view historical water temperature trends. The goal is to provide historical water
temperature data within a location in the Chesapeake Bay – in order to provide information that
can be used to uncover past trends. This information can be accessed through a user-friendly
webpage on the internet. Mariners and the general public will use the projected information to
quickly gather information for a variety of uses, including environmental research. </h2>

          <p> "The DataHub is the Chesapeake Bay Program’s primary tool for searching and downloading environmental data for the Chesapeake Bay watershed. This interface provides access to several types of data related to the Chesapeake Bay. Bay Program databases can be queried based upon user-defined inputs such as geographic region and date range. Each query results in a downloadable, tab- or comma-delimited text file that can be imported to any program (e.g., SAS, Excel, Access) for further analysis. To insure data accuracy, the Bay Program maintains a Quality Assurance Program that monitors and tracks several environmental data sets that look at pollutants, water quality, land use, algae, fish, crabs and submerged aquatic vegetation." </p>

        <h1> PROJECT SCOPE/EXPECTATIONS: Over one year, use software coding to create a user friendly database that provides water quality
information (current and historical trends) at ease. </h1>

      <div id="project-goals">
        <h1> PROJECTS GOALS AND OBSTACLES: Create a website that gathers historical water temperature data to
display a user-friendly visual representation. This website will be coded through Python to gather
the information from DataHub (data wrangling) and will relay the information visual appealing
manner. </h1>
